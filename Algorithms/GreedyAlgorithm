Algorithms are nothing but a approach you follow. 

Suppose you have coin 10, 5,2, 1 value. 
You need to carry minimum coins in hand that sum value as 28.

Simple, you would opt for highest value coin first. 
10 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1

So what did you do ?

You greedily took the max value coin first; to get the result faster. 

This approach is called greedy algorithm.

Pros:
1. Faster Results
2. Easy
3. Simple To Implement


Cons:
1. It might no always give you optimal results

How the con satisfy the real time case. 

Suppose, you have below graph and you want to implement sum of nodes from root to leaf with maximum value. 
        3
   4        7
6    20   9    11

Greedy Algo: You might go with path 3+7+11 = 21 (But this is not optimal solution)
Actual Path: 3+4+20 = 27. 


Hope This helps !!
