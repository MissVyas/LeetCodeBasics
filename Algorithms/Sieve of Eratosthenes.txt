This is the fastest way to get the prime numbers.

so the process is :
1. Create list of number  2 to n
2. According to the algorithm we will mark all the numbers which are divisible by 2 and are greater than or equal to the square of it.
3. Now we move to our next unmarked number 3 and mark all the numbers which are multiples of 3 and are greater than or equal to the square of it.
4. and so on
5. Finally you will get the list of numbers which are non divisible.
6. This is the final list of prime.

So please note:
The first bound of loop iterates only till square root of given number.
